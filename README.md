- 👋 Hi, I’m @alex-rexroad
- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging open-source code and API's in order to create a better way of product marketing that does not require invasive data mining of personal information.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about consumer data collection and am disturbed by the amount of information being collected.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ending the consumer data collection nightmare being created today.
